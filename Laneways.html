								<h2>Melbourne Laneway Coffee Spots</h2>

              <div>

                <a href="#" class="image featured"><img src="images/pic03.jpg" alt="" /></a>

                <h2>Design Rational</h2>
                <p style="text-align: left;"> In order to produce a map with clear intent and design purposes, I decided to apply a case-study to the project.
                  This gave the map direction and helped me to better make decisions to understand the map use context for the end user.</p>

                <p style="text-align: left;"> As coffee is a passion of mine, this heavily influenced who my map end user was. The client chosen was visitmelbourne.com
                  and the map to be produced was their list of top coffee spots in Melbourne Laneways. </p>

                <p style="text-align: left;"> I proceeded to extract the information I needed from the visitmelboune.com website including addresses. I used this information
                  to add additional POI’s to the dataset that was provided through the ArcMap editor tool. This allowed me to use these coffee spots
                  as points of interest, in addition to using useful POI’s already within the dataset (railway stations and visitor information centers).</p>

                <p style="text-align: left;"> Firstly, all the datasets available were imported into ArcMap. To which I filtered through the data, extracting the data that was most
                  important to the end user. As I reduced the data, I also applied some early visual hierarchies. Ensure that the focus stayed on the
                  coffee spots. I did this mainly through the use of colour.</p>

                <p style="text-align: left;"> Once I had an early iteration of a basic map, I started to sketch out some possible layouts on paper. This allowed me to visualize
                  and play around with the visual hierarchy of the map. Once I decided on a layout, I took my map into illustrator and started the design
                  process. It should be noted that there were many iterations of the design as my first-choice layout put too much focus on text which threw
                  off my visual to intellectual hierarchy ratio.</p>

                <p style="text-align: left;"> I continued through trial and error of different colour schemes, text quantity, map size etc.</p>

                <p style="text-align: left;"> Final design: The two long black sections at the top and bottom of the page act like a cinema effect and draw the readers eyes into the
                  center of the page which contains the map. Upon which they see the highlighted laneways (red to match the black, grey and red color theme)
                  and numbers symbols representing coffee spots. The user can then match the numbered label with the numbered text description of the coffee spot,
                  including name, address and brief highlight of the business. I chose numbered symbols in order to match important information that could not be
                  displayed on the map due to the amount of text required. </p>

                <p style="text-align: left;">  The river, streets and park colours were chosen to be closer to white in value, in order to keep them from overpowering
                  the important focal points.</p>

                <p style="text-align: left;"> The visitor and rail station symbols were chosen based on the readers familiarity with these symbols. They are common and often
                  used in tourist maps, and while there is a legend available on the map, generally a lot of tourists, including non-English speaking will be able to understand
                  these symbols. </p>

                <p style="text-align: left;"> Final map elements were added including legend, north arrow, scale bar, logo and data citing. The main design influences were from the placement of all
                  the elements, and colour, to achieve the best visual and intellectual hierarchy balance.</p>
