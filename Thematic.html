                <h2>Design Rational</h2>
                <p style="text-align: left;"> <strong>Data selection:</strong> <br>Victoria is renowned for being a very multicultural area made up of many different
                  languages and ethnicities.  Initially my goal was to map the linguistic diversity within the Greater Melbourne area,
                  unfortunately there was not the adequate data available through the ABS resources. I then started to think about how
                  many people come to Australia, to work, live and eventually settle. Due to the high levels of migration to Australia,
                  I decided to investigate this in more detail and discovered that a very high proportion of migrants end up settling in
                  capital cities around Australia and thought this was a detail that would be interesting to map and communicate with an
                  audience. I looked at data at a country level, then state level and finally all the way down to the SA2 level in
                  Greater Melbourne. For the map to not just be a population density map, I standardized the data by showing the
                  proportional percentage of the area’s migrants to the area’s total population. </p>

                <p style="text-align: left;"> <strong>Thematic Map Theme:</strong> <br>It was decided to use a choropleth map as these maps are very efficient
                  in representing statistical data over a geographical area. Choropleth maps are also intuitive to interrupt which makes
                  them good for representing a lot of numerical data.</p>

                <p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Enumeration Unit:</strong> <br>The proportional population percentage of each SA2 area was represented as
                  the choropleth element. However, the boundaries of each SA2 area were eventually removed, leaving the colour representation
                  isolated. This was due to having all the boundaries on the map creating a very busy, confusing, and unsightly map.  In order
                  to communicate as much information to the audience as possible, SA4 boundaries were imported and the proportional percentage
                  of each SA4 area was manually communicated with the user through text graphics. </p>

                <p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Class breaks:</strong> <br>Optimized/Natural breaks (Jenks) algorithm in ArcMap was used. This was selected as
                  this method finds breaks through an optimization procedure that minimizes variation in data values within classes but maximizes
                  variation between the classes. </p>
