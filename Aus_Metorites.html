                <h2>Design Rational</h2>
                <p style="text-align: left;">
                  As we have mapped places and cultural data already, for this assessment I wanted to map scientific data to expose myself to a wide
                  range of data sets. As space is an interest of mine, and through early research of data set sources, I found that NASA has open source
                  data. Exploring the NASA data sets led me to a comprehensive data set that originated from the Meteoritical Society and contained
                  information on all the known meteorite landings on Earth. As the list was extensive, contained a lot of information and was continuously
                  validated by NASA, it was concluded that this would be an accurate data set to work with. <p>
                  <p style="text-align: left;"> After cleaning the data, I mapped all meteorites on Earth in order to become familiar with the data but became focused on Australia as
                  there was a very interesting cluster of found meteorites which did not correlate with the rest of the distribution of meteorites in
                  Australia.<p>
                  <p style="text-align: left;">Knowing my data and focus area, I needed an end user in order to produce a map with clear intent and design purposes. Even though
                  space is a focused interest of mine, I am not widely versed in meteorites nor did time allow for the investigation needed to reach that
                  level. It is for this reason that I decided against producing a product for an end-user with expert knowledge, but an end user that was like
                  myself. Someone that has an interest and is looking to learn more. My end user is someone with fundamental awareness to intermediate
                  level of knowledge of Meteorites. The aim of the product is to educate, mainly through visuals with supplemental text. It is my intent that
                  the product could be used for high school students or to be used in support of an article on the web for the general public. This gave the
                  map direction and helped me to better make decisions to understand the map use context for the end user.</p>
                  <p style="text-align: left;">Upon further investigation, the cluster of meteorites in Australia are located across the Nullarbor Plain. Through my general knowledge I
                  knew the Nullarbor was very flat and had little to no vegetation. This must be the link to the cluster and decided that my main map
                  would focus on this. To visually convey this to the end user, a terrain representation was needed. I went through iterations of NDVI maps
                  but ended up choosing a shaded relief as the smoothness of the terrain is the main reason the meteorites are found. Shaded relief is also
                  beneficial for small details and large landforms to be easily read and would allow the user to easily see the link. I used a raster download
                  from Natural Earth and using the Spatial Analyst Tools, specifically Surface-Hillshade tool in ArcMap using an azimuth of 315° and altitude
                  of 45°. I was now able to overlay my meteorite point data, which I split into fallen and found meteorites. Wanting to show as much
                  information as possible and knowing that it is an intuitive conclusion made by people that the larger the symbol the “bigger” or in this
                  case the heavier that point data is. This made it a logical conclusion to combine my symbols with graduated symbols to represent the
                  mass of the meteorites.</p>
                  <p style="text-align: left;">It was now obvious looking at the data that meteorites seen falling in Australia were very far and few between. In order to observe a fall,
                  there needs to be people around to see it, this would mean we have a correlation between population density and visible fall. To show
                  this, I used data from the Australian Bureau of Statistics to create a choropleth map of population density so the map user could visualize
                  the link. But this still didn’t quite answer the whole question as Australia does have many densely populated places, so why don’t we see
                  more of them? I conducted some research on this and found that night sky brightness is a contributing factor. For this reason, I have
                  inserted a heat map representing the artificial night sky brightness. This was a very interesting atlas found online that was created by the
                  Light Pollution Science and Technology Institute in Italy and they provided hi-res tiff images of the world.</p>
                  <p style="text-align: left;">I also wanted to graph the top 10 class types of meteorites found. However, the may layout did not allow easy insertion of this bar graph.
                  I tried many times, but realized that sometimes less is more and also that if I had to omit any data it would be this as only a small
                  percentage of my end users would be knowledgeable in this kind of data. It was for this reason I did not include it on the map, and this
                  was probably one of my biggest learnings during this project. You may want to communicate a vast detail of data, but it will be at the
                  detriment of the effectiveness of your map and design. You need to select the most valuable data for your specific end user.</p>
